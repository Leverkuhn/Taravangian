# Taravangian

7/27/19: The first version of Taravangian tracked the minutes committed to a task, decrementing from 960 minutes--the time I'd set as a practice goal. Writing this version gave me some first exposure to the file reading and writing system of C++. Now, I'd like to expand the productivity management functionality. 

For the present update, we'll allow the user to add tasks with the following parameters: (1) Name, (2) Work Target (in minutes). We'll create a struct for tasks--future updates will expand its functionality. We will also show the user a start menu listing the tasks and asking for a selection. Then its status will be displayed, and minutes can be recorded. Future updates may measure completed/failed tasks, and allow for time limits.
